# Get Started with Microsoft Azure IoT Starter Kit - Adafruit Huzzah ESP8266

This page contains technical information to help you get familiar with Azure IoT using the Azure IoT Starter Kit - Adafruit Huzzah ESP8266. You will find two tutorials that will walk you through different scenarios: the first tutorial will show you how to connect your Azure IoT Starter kit to our Remote Monitoring preconfigured solution from Azure IoT Suite. In the second tutorial, you will leverage Azure IoT services to create your own IoT architecture.

You can choose to start with whichever tutorial you want to. If you've never worked with Azure IoT services before, we encourage you to start with the Remote Monitoring solution tutorial, because all of the Azure services will be provisioned for you in a built-in preconfigured solution. Then you can explore how each of the services work by going through the second tutorial.

 We hope you enjoy the process. Please provide feedback if there's anything that we can improve.

## 1.1 Tutorial Overview

In this tutorial, you'll be doing the following:
- Setting up your environment on Azure using the Microsoft Azure IoT Suite Remote Monitoring preconfigured solution, getting a large portion of the set-up that would be required done in one step.
- Setting your device and sensors up so that it can communicate with both your computer, and Azure IoT.
- Updating the device code sample to include our connection data and send it to Azure IoT to be viewed remotely.

## 1.2 Before Starting

### 1.2.1 Required Software

- Arduino IDE, version 1.6.8. from www.arduino.cc (Earlier versions will not work with the AzureIoT library)

### 1.2.2 Required Hardware

- Adafruit Huzzah ESP8266 kit
  - Huzzah ESP8266 board
  - DHT22 Sensor
  - breadboard
  - M/M jumper wires
  - 10k Ohm Resistor (brown, black, orange)
- A microB USB cable
- A desktop or laptop computer which can run **Arduino IDE 1.6.8**

## 1.3 Create a New Azure IoT Suite Remote Monitoring solution and Add Device

- Log in to [Azure IoT Suite](https://www.azureiotsuite.com/)  with your Microsoft account and click **Create a New Preconfigured Solution**

***
**Note:** For first time users, click here to get your [Azure free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/) which gives you 200USD of credit to get started.
***

- Click select in the **Remote Monitoring** option
- Type in a solution name. For this tutorial we’ll be using _“HuzzahSuite”_ (You will have to name it something else. Make it unique. I.E. "ContosoSample")

***
**Note:** Make sure to copy down the names and connection strings mentioned into a text document for reference later.
***

- Choose your subscription and desired region to deploy, then click **Create Solution**
- Wait for Azure to finish provisioning your IoT suite (this process may take up to 10 minutes), and then click **Launch**

***
**Note:** You may be asked to log back in. This is to ensure your solution has proper permissions associated with your account.
***

- Open the link to your IoT Suite’s “Solution Dashboard.” You may have been redirected there already.
- This opens your personal remote monitoring site at the URL _&lt;Your Azure IoT Hub suite name&gt;.azurewebsites.net_ (e.g. _HuzzahSuite.azurewebsites.net_)
- Click **Add a Device** at the lower left hand corner of your screen
- Add a new **custom device**
- Enter your desired `device ID`. In this case we’ll use _“Huzzah_w_DHT22”_, and then click Check ID
- If Device ID is available, go ahead and click **Create**
- Make note of your `device ID`, `Device Key`, and `IoT Hub Hostname` to enter into the code you’ll run on your device later 

***
**Warning:** The Remote Monitoring solution provisions a set of Azure IoT Services in your Azure account. It is meant to reflect a real enterprise architecture and thus it's Azure consumption is quite heavy. To avoid unnecessary Azure consumption, we recommend you Delete the preconfigured solution in azureiotsuite.com once you are done with your work (since it is easy to recreate). Alternatively, if you want to keep it up and running you can do two things to reduce consumption:

1) Disable the simulated devices created with the solution (Go to Devices>>Select the device>> on the device details menu on the right, clich on Disable Device. Repeat with all the simulated devices).

2) **Stop** your remote monitoring solution while you are working on the next steps. (See: [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting))

## 1.4 Connect the DHT22 Sensor Module to your Device

- Using [this image](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/iot-hub-c-huzzah-getstartedkit/blob/master/img/huzzah_remote_monitoring.png?raw=true) as a reference, connect your DHT22 and Adafruit Huzzah ESP8266 to the breadboard

***
**Note:** Column on the left corresponds to sensor and on the Right to board. On the image, the board is place between 10 and 30, with the RST pin connected to row 30, and sensor between 1 and 9, with the VDD pin connected to the row 1.
***
- Connect the board, sensor and parts on the breadboard:

| Start                   | End                    | Connector     |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------: |
| Huzzah RST (Pin 30i)    | Huzzah CHPD (Pin 15i)  | Huzzah ESP8266 |
| DHT22 (Pin 1J)          | DHT22 (Pin 4J)         | DHT22         |
| Pin 2I                  | Pin 1F                 | 10k Ohm Resistor  |

- For sensor pins, we will use the following wiring:

| Start                   | End                    | Cable Color   |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------: |
| VDD (Pin 1G)            | Pin 29J                | Red cable     |
| DATA (Pin 2G)           | Pin 17B                | White cable   |
| GND (Pin 4G)            | Pin 27J                | Black cable   |


- For more information, see: [Adafruit DHT22 sensor setup](https://learn.adafruit.com/dht/connecting-to-a-dhtxx-sensor).

**At the end of your work, your Adafruit Huzzah ESP8266 should be connected with a working sensor.**

## 1.5 Add the Adafruit Huzzah ESP8266 to the Arduino IDE

You will need to install the Adafruit Huzzah ESP8266 board extension for the Arduino IDE:

- Follow the instructions [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-huzzah-esp8266-breakout/using-arduino-ide). There you will see how to add a URL pointing to Adafruit's repository of board extensions, how to make the Adafruit Huzzah ESP8266 board selectable under the **Tools** menu, and how to get the Blink sketch to run.
  - **Note**: There are two versions of Huzzah board, one with microB USB connector and other with a USB cable connected directly to the board. Both works properly with Azure IoT.
  - Boards with microB connector don't have the GPIO0 button. So, in the 'Blink Test', ignore the steps to put the board in the bootload mode, and go directly to the step to upload the sketch via the IDE.
- After going through this, you should have a working sample with a blinking light on your board.
    - If you run into any connection issues, unplug the board, hold the reset button, and while still holding it, plug the board back in. This will flash to board to try again.

## 1.6 Install Library Dependencies

For this project, we'll also need the following libraries:

 - DHT Sensor Library
 - Adafruit DHT Unified
 - AzureIoTHub

 To install them, click on the `Sketch -> Include Library -> Manage Libraries`. Search for each library using the box in the upper-right to filter your search, click on the found library, and click the "Install" button.

The Adafruit Sensor library is also needed. This can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Sensor). Instructions for manually installing a library can be found [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries).


***
**Note**: If you have an earlier version of the IoT library, navigate to your Arduino documents directory. Inside the "Libraries" folder, there will be a number of installed libraries. Simply delete the `AzureIoT` folder.
***

Lastly we will also need the latest esp8266 Arduino library
- Visit https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino and follow the instructions for "Using git version"

## 1.7 Modify the Remote Monitoring sample

- Unzip the example code, and double-click the file `remote_monitoring.ino` to open the project in the Arduino IDE.
- You will be prompted to creat a folder. Do this, and move the other files in the folder into the newly created child folder
- In the project, look for the following lines of code:

```
static const char ssid[] = "[Your WiFi network SSID or name]";
static const char pass[] = "[Your WiFi network WPA password or WEP key]";
```

- Replace the placeholders with your WiFi name (SSID), WiFi password, and the device connection string you created at the beginning of this tutorial. 
- Save with `Control-s`

- Open up the file `remote_monitoring.c`
- Look for the following lines of code and replace the placeholders connection information (this is the Device information that you obtained in the Remote Monitoring console):

```
static const char* deviceId = "[device-id]";
static const char* deviceKey = "[device-key]";
static const char* hubName = "[hub-name]";
static const char* hubSuffix = "azure-devices.net";
```

- Save with `Control-s`

## 1.8 Build Your Remote Monitoring Sample

- Select the COM port on the Arduino IDE. Use **Tools -&gt; Port -&gt; COM** to select it.
- Build the code using **Sketch -&gt; Verify/Compile**.
  - This step is not really necessary, but can provide you a good feedback about what you've done up to now.
  - If your code is correct and all libraries was properly installed, you will receive something like the follow message in the IDE.

  ```
  Sketch uses 376,409 bytes (36%) of program storage space. Maximum is 1,044,464 bytes.
  Global variables use 50,220 bytes (61%) of dynamic memory, leaving 31,700 bytes for
    local variables. Maximum is 81,920 bytes.
  ```

- Now you are ready to build and upload the code. Use **Sketch -&gt;  Upload** on Arduino IDE.

***
**Note**: As of 1.6.8, the Arduino IDE doesn't properly show "Upload Completed", even when it succeeds.
***

- There should now be a green LED on your Adafruit Huzzah ESP8266. Re-select the COM port if necessary, and then open the serial. On the Arduino IDE, use **Tools -&gt; Serial Monitor**. After 15 seconds you should see a measurements update.

***
**Note**: When first starting you will likely see a “Fetching NTP epoch time failed” error – This is normal, and it trying to sync with Azure. This can take even up to 30 seconds to find a NTP server to sync with. One it is synced, it should start transmitting from there.
***

## 1.9 View the Sensor Data from the Remote Monitoring Portal

- Once you have the sample running, visit your dashboard by visiting azureiotsuite.com and clicking “Launch” on your solution
- Make sure the “Device to View” in the upper right is set to your device
- If the demo is running, you should see the graph change as your data updates in real time!

***
**Note:** Make sure to **stop** your remote monitoring solution once you have completed this to avoid unnecessary Azure consumption!  (See: [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting))
***

INTO
    TemperatureTableStorage
from TempSensors
WHERE
   DeviceId is not null
   and EventTime is not null

SELECT
    DeviceId,
    EventTime,
    MTemperature as TemperatureReading
INTO   
    TemperatureAlertToEventHub
FROM
    TempSensors
WHERE MTemperature>25
```

***
**Note:** You can change the `25` to `0` when you're ready to generate alerts to look at. This number represents the temperature in degrees celsius to check for when creating alerts. 25 degrees celsius is 77 degrees fahrenheit.
***

- Back to the **Stream Analytics Job blade**, click on the **Outputs** tile and in the **Outputs blade**, click on **Add**
- Enter the following settings then click on **Create**:

        - If you named it something else, enter the name you used instead.    

```
{
    "port": "3000",
    "eventHubName": "event-hub-name",
    "ehConnString": "Endpoint=sb://name.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=readwrite;SharedAccessKey=aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa=",
    "deviceId": "iot-hub-device-name",
    "iotHubConnString": "HostName=iot-hub-name.azure-devices.net;SharedAccessKeyName=service;SharedAccessKey=aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa=",
    "storageAcountName": "aaaaaaaaaaa",
    "storageAccountKey": "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa==",
    "storageTable": "TemperatureRecords"
}
```

- Now it is time to run it! Enter the following command:

```
node server.js
```

- You should then see something similar to:

```
app running on http://localhost:3000
client connected
```

- Visit the url in your browser and you will see the Node app running!

To deploy this project to the cloud using Azure, you can reference [Creating a Node.js web app in Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/web-sites-nodejs-develop-deploy-mac/).

Next, we will update your device so that it can interact with all the things you just created.

## 2.9 Add the Adafruit Huzzah ESP8266 to the Arduino IDE

You will need to install the Adafruit Huzzah ESP8266 board extension for the Arduino IDE:

- Follow the instructions [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-huzzah-esp8266-breakout/using-arduino-ide). There you will see how to add a URL pointing to Adafruit's repository of board extensions, how to make the Adafruit Huzzah ESP8266 board selectable under the **Tools** menu, and how to get the Blink sketch to run.
  - As we explained on the item 1.5, boards with microB connector don't have the GPIO0 button. So, in the 'Blink Test', ignore the steps to put the board in the bootload mode, and go directly to the step to upload the sketch via the IDE.
- After going through this, you should have a working sample with a blinking light on your board.
    - If you run into any connection issues, unplug the board, hold the reset button, and while still holding it, plug the board back in. This will flash to board to try again.


## 2.10 Install Library Dependencies

For this project, we'll also need the the following libraries:

 - DHT Sensor Library
 - Adafruit Sensor Library
 - Adafruit DHT Unified

 To install them, click on the `Sketch -> Include Library -> Manage Libraries`. Search for each library using the box in the upper-right to filter your search, click on the found library, and click the "Install" button.

 We will also need the latest Azure IoT Library.
 - Go to https://github.com/stefangordon/AzureIoT/ and follow the instructions under "ESP8266"

***
**Note**: If you have an earlier version of the IoT library, navigate to your Arduino documents directory. Inside the "Libraries" folder, there will be a number of installed libraries. Simply delete the `AzureIoT` folder.
***

Lastly we will also need the latest esp8266 Arduino library
- Visit https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino and follow the instructions for "Using git version"

## 2.11 Modify the Command Center sample

- Unzip the example code, and double-click the file `command_center.ino` to open the project in the Arduino IDE.
- You will be prompted to creat a folder. Do this, and move the other files in the folder into the newly created child folder
- Look for the following lines of code:

```
static const char ssid[] = "[Your WiFi network SSID or name]";
static const char pass[] = "[Your WiFi network WPA password or WEP key]";
static const char* connectionString = "[Device Connection String]";
```

- Replace the placeholders with your WiFi name (SSID), WiFi password, and the device connection string you created at the beginning of this tutorial. 
- Save with `Control-s`

- In the same project, click on the `command_center_https.c` tab to see that file.
- Look for the following lines of code:

```
static const char DeviceId[] = "[Device Name]";
static const char connectionString[] = "[Device Connection String]";
```

- Replace the placeholders with your Device ID and connection string you created at the beginning of this tutorial. 
- Save with `Control-s`

## 2.12 Build Your Command Center Sample

- Build and upload the code using **Sketch -&gt;  Upload**.

***
**Note**: As of 1.6.8, the Arduino IDE doesn't properly show "Upload Completed", even when it succeeds.
***

- There should now be a green LED on your Adafruit Huzzah ESP8266. Re-select the COM port if necessary, and then open the Serial Monitor. After 15 seconds you should see a measurements update.
- Data is now being sent off at regular intervals to Microsoft Azure. When it detects something out of range, you will see the LED you’ve set up turn from green to red!

Head back to your Node application and you will have a fully functional command center, complete with a history of sensor data, alerts that display when the temperature got outside a certain range, and commands that you can send to your device remotely.

***
**Note:** Make sure to **stop** your Command Center jobs once you have when you finish to avoid unnecessary Azure consumption!  (See: [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting))
